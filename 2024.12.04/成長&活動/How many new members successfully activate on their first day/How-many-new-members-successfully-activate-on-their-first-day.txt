How many new members successfully activate on their first day?
A new member is "activated" when they understand what the community is about and why itâ€™s a fit for them. Usually, this is reflected by them at least sending a message or exploring the server beyond the first few channels.
New members who don't activate tend to remain inactive, so try to improve this. How can you make it easier for new members to onboard into your community?

tip:If the chart looks crazy, you may not have enough new members joining daily. Try changing the interval to Weekly or Monthly.
