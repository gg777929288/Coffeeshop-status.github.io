How many new members retain the next week?
Retention measures how many new members stick around in the server beyond their first day. To improve this number, focus on improving activation (see chart above) and making your community more active.
How to read the numbers: If April 1st has a Week 1 Retention of 20% with 10 new members joining, it means that of the 10 new people who joined, 2 of them came back to the server again the next week (April 8th - April 15th). As such, the retention line will always be 2 weeks behind the current date.
tip:If the chart looks crazy, you may not have enough new members joining daily. Try changing the interval to Weekly or Monthly.
